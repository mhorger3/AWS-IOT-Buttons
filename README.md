# AWS IOT Buttons

I have two IoT buttons currently at my desk at home setup so that if I press one of them, it sends me a text message and the other sends me an email.

My plans are to incorporate these buttons into a project where I can track my allergy conditions so that if I press one button, it triggers a text response saying I had a good day managing allergy symptoms whereas the other button triggers a negative response. I want to then compile all the data into a visualizer with weather and pollen data so I can track health trends.

I am going to be using https://openweathermap.org/api as the source of weather information.
